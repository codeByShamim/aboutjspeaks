    <div id="desc01-pl01" class="description">
       <p>Windy Hill Play is a nonprofit child care organization on a mission to create accessible, flexible and abundant spaces for children to play freely and grow in confidence! Within the episode I interview Mariah King and Princess Rahman - CEO and COO of Windy Hill Play.</p>

      <div id="title04pl03" class="title">Introducing Express & Release Therapeutic Dance</div>
      <div id="desc04-pl03" class="description">
        <p>
            Meet Gabrielle Rivero - CMO and Founder of Express & Release Therapeutic Dance. Express & Release Therapeutic Dance creates a safe space for kids, adults and seniors to recognize and release emotions from their bodies through movement. Gabby and her greater team help communities learn how to accept the emotions that they feel, express these emotions through safe movements that do not harm the self, others or the environment, and if desired, then to release these emotions from the self. It is Gabby’s hopes and dreams for therapeutic dance to one day be normalized and be used as a stress relief and to cope with life’s daily transitions!
        </p>
        <p>
            Express & Release helps individuals learn how to process emotions in their bodies through movement to find hope, healing, and restoration in their bodies. Research has proven that movement can be highly effective in the senior population:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>- Reduces anxiety and depression</li>
            <li>- Improve balance and lower fall risk</li>
            <li>- It can boost feelings of control and resilience</li>
            <li>- Improve Health Outcomes related to Dementia</li>
            <li>- Improve Health Outcomes related to Parkinson's Disease</li>
            <li>- Improve blood pressure, bone density, muscle tone, mobility, flexibility, balance,and coordination.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Through S.A.F.E. Movement Practice, Gabby guides her clients  through gentle movements that help them re-learn their mobility and confidence as they embrace safe movements that feel good to their bodies. In her movement sessions, she does  not teach technique as she invites each individual to explore movement that feels comfortable and right for their own body. Gabby guides her students through remembering images, thoughts, sounds, feelings, and colors that are connected to their bodies.

        <div id="title02pl04" class="title">What is Health Equity?</div>
           <div id="desc02-pl04" class="description">
            <p>
                Dr. Tanya M. Bass (she/her) is an award-winning sexuality educator and a mental health advocate that is committed to advancing health equity through culturally responsive and inclusive professional development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Advancing health equity is a critical part of any public health framework. Gaining a better understanding on how racism and discrimination are root causes of health disparities through a historical perspective allows organizations to make better policy and programmatic decisions. Dismantling systems of oppression requires consistent learning, assessment, and collective support.

                Dr. Bass supports organizations develop health equity frameworks with an understanding of the social, economic, environmental, and cultural determinants and drivers of health. Tanya has been working to increase cultural consciousness and reduce health disparities for more than 20 years. She has provided technical assistance and support to state and local governments and communities by using the CLAS standards to reach the underserved and marginalized.

                Do you know that we are currently in a maternal health crisis? Women all across the United States are dying from childbirth due to not receiving quality  prenatal care and the proper support and respect along their birthing journey. Tune in as I interview Maya Jackson, Founder and Executive Director of Mobilizing African American Women Through Empowerment (MAAME, Inc.), who empowers Black, Indigenous and other birthing people of color to navigate health systems. MAAME offers resources and support for holistic maternal health and wellness. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Maya  became a volunteer Doula to give support to mothers and families who needed more guidance along their birthing journey. As a mother of five she’s experienced birthing in a hospital and birth center. MAAME was founded through lived experiences and the concerns of her community. Maya currently serves her community as a full spectrum Doula, maternal and infant health advocate, child birth educator and lactation peer counselor.

            <p>
                I had the privilege to speak to both middle schoolers and adults at "Durham Divinity School" on the difference between Wisdom and Knowledge. It is important for all of us to utilize our Godly wisdom in all things and always make a conscious effort to do what is right in order to fulfill the will of God.

            <p>
                Be open to building an intimate relationship with God in order to get the best results in life. As the word of God says, trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight” (Proverbs 3:5,6). Always choose to be discerning and channel your Godly wisdom in times of distress. Don’t let your emotions control you and have you react to everything without taking time for proper prayer, silence and meditation. When you grow in your ability to discern and can effectively channel your Godly wisdom you will avoid so many potential potential problems.

            <p>
                Don't let your emotions dictate your happiness and gratitude towards all of the wonderful things that God has done (and will continue to do) in your life. Our emotions urge us toward haste, telling us that we must do something and or feel a certain way right now. Something that is so unstable and fleeting shouldn't solely determine how grateful  you are of your now and all of the beautifulness that is in front of you.

No matter what we are going through in life it shouldn’t be too great that it distracts us from appreciating all of Gods wonderfulness. Yes, keep your eyes on what’s ahead of you and what you wish to accomplish but take ample time to consider, ponder about and appreciate your now and how far God has brought you in your life.

                It is so easy for us to get frustrated with our best. We have to remind ourselves that when we embark on any journey there is always a starting point. Something that we aspire to grow in, be more proficient in and master - will take time, there is no way around it. To make this inevitable journey, this building period, more bearable on our psyche and spirit we must be patient and trust in the lord with all our heart and lean not to our own understanding but in all ways submit to him and he will straighten our path (Proverbs 3:5 - 6).

                There are so many takeaways from this avoidable tragedy that we can all learn from. Being open to hearing and instilling others advice and constructive criticism is a favorable and mature habit. The word of God says: do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves (Philippians 2:3). 
            </p>
            <p>
                No matter how right or assured we are within ourselves, I urge you to be open to the advice of others and seek God with an open heart so that God can reveal himself to you - show you his grace, mercy and answer your prayers. God does not reveal himself to prideful people because arrogant people don’t want to know him. The word of God says: God oppresses the proud and gives grace to the humble (James 4:6).

                "Jesus I can't do this anymore. I am done trying to solve thing on my own. I need you now. I am choosing to trust you. I am trusting you more than I trust myself. I am choosing to trust you more than any scheme or worldly solution. Although this is not what I want to do and quite frankly this is not what I am comfortable doing, I surrender to you. I want you to solve my problems rather than me solve my problems for myself. I want your powers to work in my circumstance. I want your love to flow through me rather than passivity and aggression.

            <p>
                Embrace Discomforts For Your Benefit | Taking risk before sitting around. Being doubtful, nervous, and uncomfortable towards something new, daring or risky has always been a prevalent feeling amongst all of us when we face the unknown. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to be open to taking risks before sitting around and being complacent about life and just “going with the flow”. As long as your goals are worth that much to you then experiencing failure and discomfort (along your journey) shouldn’t deter you from YOUR “promise land” and what you want out of life.

                I believe that real love gets it’s hands dirty. Anybody who says they love you should get their hands dirty before they let you go off a cliff. You can’t say you love me, see me destroying myself and not confront me because you are more concerned about being nice over me being healed. I can’t speak for everyone but me personally? I want you to get in my mug and say “wait a minute you are about to mess your life up”. What I am talking about is trusting God even when it hurts.

                On the contrary, I have learned through experience that you can lead a horse to a body of water but you cannot make the horse drink. This is an idiom in english that means, you can show someone the way to do something, provide them with the materials and tools to do it but at the end of the day THEY are the ones who need to want to change  for themselves. They have to find the motivation and take action themselves - you can’t force them.

                Changing bad habits takes more than solely prayer. It boils down to your discipline. It takes a lot to buckle down and put in the time, effort and or money to solve your problems and change. In order to make permeant, everlasting change in your behavior it will require you to carry out opposite, fruitful habits that you are disciplined, consistent with and hold yourself accountable. Only after that will prayer start to enhance and favor you along your journey.

                I had the pleasure to speak to 19 graduate students at North Carolina A&T on ‘teamwork’. I spoke on the importance of working towards your purpose and having a sense of direction in life first so that you can keenly select individuals who are aligned with your morals, interests, aspirations to be apart of your team. I then discussed how one can begin to brainstorm on how to answer the question ‘what is my purpose’ by following my 4C’s - courage, confidence, competence and community. I enjoyed every bit of this experience and I am excited to impart more words of wisdom and encouragement to the world.

           <div id="desc05-pl07" class="description">
               <p>
                Often referred to as a Swiss Army Knife because of her sharp and versatile skills, Rada B. Mills has spent her professional career using those skills to help others succeed. As a serial social entrepreneur, she has founded multiple companies and has partnered with several organizations that have a required common principle: community. Creating and building a connected community aligns with why she felt a calling to be an entrepreneur. Her superpower is helping people find their voice, tell their stories, and build sustainable and equitable businesses using their gifts and talents.
               </p>
               <p>
                She was born and raised in NC and has over 20 years of experience as an entrepreneur. Coining the term "Accidental Superhero," It's been her mission to ensure that the path to entrepreneurship is accessible for all. She has continuously focused her skills and talents on helping others, especially those from marginalized communities, build, nurture, and grow their businesses. Her love for volunteering and being a community advocate is essential and part of her everyday living. She's honored to provide that advocacy by serving on the boards of several non-profit organizations and as a mentor at several entrepreneurship incubators and hubs.
               </p>
               <p>
                She owns a Boutique Public Relations + Marketing agency, a Commercial Photography Company, a Candle and Skin Care line, and an Online Consignment Shop. In addition, she's the author of a children's book (with a second one already in the works), and her latest endeavor is being the Founder + Editor in Chief of 1865 Magazine, a multicultural curated lifestyle publication set to launch in 2025. In her spare time, this self-proclaimed "foodie" enjoys doing standup comedy, trying out new restaurants and DIY projects, and spending time with her two (entrepreneurial) teen daughters.

                            North Carolina is ranked 42nd among states with the highest prevalence and lowest access to mental health services for youth, and suicide is now the second leading cause of death for North Carolina youth ages 10 - 18 (NCDHHS, 2024).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            BIPOC youth with mental health challenges are more likely to be directed to the juvenile justice system than non-Latinx white youth. They face higher rates of harsh disciplinary and expulsion practices that divert them to the juvenile justice system, as opposed to appropriate mental health services (American Psychiatric Association).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Resiliency Collaborative (TRC) was established in the Spring of 2022 in response to youth requests for mental health, healing justice and a youth-led space. The organization works alongside BIPOC youth in Wake County, North Carolina to foster a sense of belonging, promote youth voices and foster the capacity to thrive and drive equitable change.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            TRC offers the following programs for BIPOC youth: Leadership Development, Educational Equity & Academics and Mental Health & Wellness.
